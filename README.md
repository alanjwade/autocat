Using GnuCash and piecash, replace the downloaded bank tranasction descriptions with one of your choosing and assign a different split account automatically.
## Motivation
I wanted to stop paying Quicken's subscription fees. I didn't use any of the new features, and the only features I cared about were downloading bank/credit card transactions, renaming payees, and automatically categoriezing transactions. None of these warranted paying Quicken every year.

I found GnuCash. It doesn't do all the things I want, but it does have a way to make them happen.
